<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy Tobacco Online at Native Smokes for Less</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you just got home from work and want to relax a little bit. You then grabbed your pack of cigarettes, only to find out that you’re out of smokes already. Fortunately, you’re living near a retailer that sells a bunch of tobacco products.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you enter the store, you’re greeted by a wide variety of cigarettes from different brands. However, you cannot find your favourite flavour of the said tobacco products. At this point, you are getting frustrated since you are not in the mood to try other flavours or brands of cigarettes. You then decided to just buy whatever the store recommends and go home.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoking cigarettes that you don’t actually like can be irritating, especially if you don’t like the hits you get from them. Plus, the effort of actually going to the store has exhausted your remaining energy. Fortunately, you can avoid all these things by buying tobacco online.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Problem with Physical Stores</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before knowing why buying tobacco online can be advantageous to you, you must first know the issues of buying your well-loved tobacco products in physical stores.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Higher Prices of Tobacco Products</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Items sold in physical stores often cost higher than those being sold online. The same thing happens with tobacco products, regardless of their brands, supply, and many more factors. The reason why physical stores tend to sell them at higher prices is due to the amount of expenses they have to incur every time they operate. Some of these expenses include store rent, utilities, employee salaries, and taxes imposed on tobacco products. They don’t have a choice but to increase the selling prices of tobacco products just to cover everything. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Limited Selection and Product Availability:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just like the introduction of the blog, physical stores tend to have issues with product availability every now and then. Most of the time, they only restock tobacco products that come from major brands since they are known to sell better. And even though they have already restocked products from these brands, these stores only get limited flavours. So, if you’re one of those buyers who want a specific product, it would be best for you to get it online.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Availability Issues and Stock Shortages</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Somehow related to the previous point, physical stores tend to face availability issues and stock shortages since they are directly affected by supply chain delays, high demand for particular tobacco products, and limited shipments of specialty tobacco. At this point, consumers have no choice but to settle for a different product, visit multiple stores, or wait until the stores restock.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Government Regulations and ID Checks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/smoking-tobacco/regulating-tobacco-vaping/tobacco.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tobacco sales in Canada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are heavily regulated by the government, which is why buying cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products from a physical store comes with plenty of restrictions. These restrictions include display bans and flavour bans. Stores also have to verify the ages of their buyers and can refuse service to those who might have forgotten their respective IDs.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Buying Tobacco Online Works</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the issues and restrictions with buying tobacco products in physical stores, it would be best that you get them from </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/credit-card/advantages-of-online-shopping/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online retailers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Buying tobacco products online works due to the following reasons:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Convenient and Accessible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Physical stores typically have limited operating hours. Once they are closed, you have to wait for the next day before you can purchase from them. Online retailers, alternatively, are open 24/7. You can basically browse through their website, check the availability of your chosen products, and place orders at your convenience. You then have to wait for the store to confirm your purchases.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Better Prices and More Discounts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: While physical stores sometimes offer discounts with their offerings, online retailers tend to generally offer tobacco products at a much lower price. They also tend to provide discounts more frequently. The reason why tobacco products are cheaper online is because online retailers don’t have to pay high rental and utility fees. And even though they still have to pay employee wages, they won’t be as high as those in physical stores. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>More Products Available</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Perhaps the best reason why buying tobacco online works is you can essentially buy more products online. One key advantage of online shopping is product availability. Online retailers offer a wide range of native cigarettes, dipping tobacco, loose-leaf tobacco, rolling papers, blunt wraps, and Grabba leaves from various brands. Physical stores tend to limit the availability of these products, especially if they feel that they might not sell them as quickly as possible.</span></li>
